### Graduate research assistant for a project about sampling and modeling of emerging contaminants in groundwater 
We are looking for a graduate research assistant to work on a project related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). These are toxic and persistent organic chemicals that are widely used to improve product durability. Recent publications show that they are detected in surface water and tap water in Lee County, Florida. 
#### About the Project
This is a pilot study on the assessment of PFAS that is funded by the Head Start Program of the Whitaker College of Engineering (WCE) at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGUC). This project is a collaboration between the WCE and The Water School (TWS) at FGUC. The project will assess PFAS in shallow groundwater in Lee County, Florida through sampling and lab analysis using LC-MS/MS at TWS. The project will demonstrate the simulation of subsurface transport and transformation of PFAS, for practical applications. Dr. Osman Karatum at the WCE is the Project Investigator (PI). The Co-PI Dr. Ahmed S. Elshall with joint appointment at the WCE and TWS will lead a task about PFAS modeling. This task will provide a preliminary demonstration of the use of public-domain subsurface transport models (e.g., MT3D) to simulate PFAS transport and transformation in the saturated zones and discuss potential methods for the unsaturated zone. 

#### Your Tasks
-	Develop a numerical model with a synthetic aquifer to demonstrate the transport and fate modeling of PFAS in the saturated zone (required)
-	Discuss PFAS modeling in the unsaturated zone (tentative) 
-	Provide a 2-page report with figures to document your problem statement, method, and findings, which the PI will use to create a blogpost (required)
-	Present your results at a symposium or conference of your choice (optional) 

#### Your Profile
-	You have a background in subsurface flow and reactive transport modeling using MODFLOW and MT3D, or you register for the ENG 4932 / ENG 5932C Special Topic: Groundwater Hydrology in the Spring 2023 semester (T-R 4:30-5:45 pm).
-	You are a person, who is willing to plunge into unfamiliar disciplines, and explore and test new ideas.

#### Start and End Dates
-	You should be able to start by no later than April 1, 2023 and complete the required tasks by no later than June 30, 2023.

#### We Offer
-	A modest stipend of $1,500, which is $15/hour for 100 hours, will be provided.
-	Co-PI Elshall will guide you through the process and provide you with tutorials.

#### Application
-	If you are interested in participating in this multidisciplinary project, please contact [Dr. Ahmed S. Elshall](mailto:aelshall@fgcu.edu) and [Dr. Osman Karatum](mailto:okaratum@fgcu.edu). Please include your preferred start date and your CV.

# [LLM-Powered Dashboard for Groundwater Climate Resiliency in South Florida](https://aselshall.github.io/ads/ai)

### Abstract

The LLM-powered decision-support dashboard is an innovation in stakeholder engagement, designed to synthesize complex information (e.g., rainfall, groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, water quality, and flood data) into actionable recommendations. Rather than providing static reports, this interactive tool allows stakeholders to query the project’s complex results using natural language, receiving personalized answers about the climate impacts on their specific operations. This transforms the project’s findings from a dataset into an on-demand advisory service, designed to accelerate the adoption of this sustainable practice.   To support stakeholder decision-making with structured, transparent reasoning, we will develop a new platform using fine-tuned large language models such as LLaMA-2 trained on a curated corpus of project-generated datasets, regional water resources reports (e.g., South Florida Water Management District, U.S. Geological Survey), and peer-reviewed studies on Florida hydrology and ecology. Using a retrieval-augmented generation framework, the system will ground its answers in cited source material, providing users not only with context-aware recommendations but also with transparent references and confidence scores. Geospatial data will populate a Python-based, open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that reuses existing project workflows to expedite analysis and deployment. For example, a city council member could ask: “By 2050, how many blocks along 5th Ave S in Naples will be flooded during regular high tides combined with  King tide, with and without a 10-ft storm surge, under medium and high emissions scenarios?” This innovation addresses a critical environmental challenge in water resources management and climate resiliency while reducing barriers for non-expert stakeholders.

### What we Provide
- Project datasets and workflows, plus guidance on required Python packages
- Frontend guidance for a browser-based UI
- Manuscript mentorship with the goal of a high quality **peer-reviewed publication** (beyond a capstone report)
- Open-access publication fees covered
- Travel support for 1 student (or 2 going together) to present at a national conference (e.g., AGU Fall Meeting, San Francisco - One week).

## A Second Project: Machine Learning and Red Tides
This is another project that is funded by NSF [Link]. We have the method developed and an exiting machine learning model that we want to extend and improve. We just need someone to do the work. For this project we offer the same as the other projec: Project data + existing ML model, close guidance and support from Ahmed Elshall, manuscrip mentorship (and we can have amny publications from this project), covering publication fess in reputable open-access journals, and travel support for 1 or 2 students to AGU. Here are some specific research questions that you will be working on:
- **[Scenario Analysis of Nutrient Loading Mitigation to Reduce Red Tide Risk](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/projects/p04.md)**: Involves enhancing harmful algal bloom mitigation through advanced machine learning
- **[Analyzing the Role of Temperature in Red Tide Dynamics Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/aselshall/rm/blob/main/hw/projects/p03.md)**: Involves enhancing harmful algal bloom prediction through advanced machine learning
- **[Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Prediction and Uncertainty Analysis of Red Tide](https://github.com/aselshall/ads/blob/main/enkf.md)**: Improve harmful algal bloom prediction using deep learning with uncertainty analysis

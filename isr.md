## **3. Can you describe a project where you successfully implemented nature-based solutions to address environmental challenges? What were the outcomes?**

**Answer:**

Certainly. One notable project I led focused on **enhancing climate resiliency of groundwater resources in South Florida** through nature-based solutions. The region faces significant challenges due to changing rainfall patterns and sea-level rise, which threaten both water quality and availability.

We implemented a series of **nature-based infrastructure interventions**, such as the restoration of wetlands and the creation of green spaces designed to naturally manage stormwater and recharge aquifers. These solutions were complemented by adaptive management strategies that integrated real-time monitoring and community involvement.

The outcomes were highly positive:

- **Improved Water Quality and Quantity:** The restored wetlands acted as natural filters, improving water quality by reducing nutrient loads and contaminants. They also enhanced groundwater recharge rates, contributing to more sustainable water supplies.
  
- **Enhanced Flood Protection:** The nature-based solutions provided effective stormwater management, reducing flood risks during extreme weather events.
  
- **Biodiversity and Ecosystem Health:** The project led to increased habitat availability, supporting local biodiversity and promoting healthier ecosystems.
  
- **Community Benefits:** The green spaces provided recreational areas and improved aesthetic value, enhancing overall community well-being and fostering greater public support for sustainability initiatives.

This project demonstrated the efficacy of nature-based solutions in addressing complex environmental challenges while delivering multiple co-benefits. At ISR, I envision leveraging similar approaches tailored to the unique ecological and cultural contexts of Hawai‘i, promoting resilience through strategies that work in harmony with natural systems.

## **4. How do you approach stakeholder and community engagement in your projects, and how would you foster collaborative partnerships at ISR?**

**Answer:**

Engaging stakeholders and communities is integral to the success and sustainability of environmental projects. My approach involves early and continuous engagement, transparency, and building trust through active collaboration.

In the **socioenvironmental systems** project addressing health disparities in polluted urban lakes, we conducted extensive outreach to understand community concerns, values, and needs. We organized workshops, focus groups, and participatory mapping exercises, ensuring that community members had a voice in the decision-making process.

Key strategies included:

- **Inclusive Participation:** We invited diverse stakeholders, including local residents, community leaders, government agencies, and NGOs, to contribute insights and feedback throughout the project lifecycle.
  
- **Co-Creation of Solutions:** By working collaboratively, we developed interventions that were culturally appropriate and aligned with community priorities, enhancing acceptance and long-term sustainability.
  
- **Education and Capacity Building:** We provided training and resources to empower community members, enabling them to actively participate in monitoring and maintaining environmental improvements.

At ISR, I would apply these principles by establishing strong partnerships with local communities, indigenous groups, government entities, and industry partners. This could involve creating stakeholder advisory boards, facilitating community-driven research projects, and developing educational programs that address local sustainability challenges.

By fostering a collaborative environment, ISR can ensure that its initiatives are responsive to the needs of the communities it serves, thereby enhancing the relevance, impact, and sustainability of its programs.

## **5. Can you discuss your experience in managing and coordinating complex projects and teams, particularly those involving multiple disciplines and institutions?**

**Answer:**

Throughout my career, I have successfully managed several complex, interdisciplinary projects that required coordinating diverse teams and resources across multiple institutions.

For example, in the **coupled inland-coastal systems project** focusing on marine harmful algal blooms (HABs), I led a collaborative team comprising experts in hydrology, oceanography, atmospheric science, data science, and public health from various universities and agencies, including FDEP and NASA.

My management approach included:

- **Clear Communication:** Establishing open and effective communication channels to ensure all team members were aligned on project goals, timelines, and responsibilities.
  
- **Defined Roles and Responsibilities:** Clarifying each member's role based on their expertise, which facilitated efficient workflow and accountability.
  
- **Integrated Workflows:** Developing integrated methodologies that combined different disciplines, such as using machine learning models to analyze data from hydrological, oceanic, and atmospheric sources.
  
- **Adaptive Management:** Implementing flexible project management practices that allowed us to adapt to new findings and challenges, ensuring the project remained on track and objectives were met.
  
- **Performance Monitoring:** Regularly assessing progress through meetings, reports, and milestones, and making necessary adjustments to optimize outcomes.

This project culminated in the development of advanced predictive models for red tide events, contributing to more effective management and mitigation strategies.

At ISR, I would leverage this experience to oversee complex sustainability projects, ensuring efficient coordination among diverse stakeholders and disciplines. I would implement structured project management frameworks tailored to the unique needs of each initiative, promoting collaboration, innovation, and successful delivery of project objectives.

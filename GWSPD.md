### Postdoc Position: Groundwater modeling, climate change, and nature-based infrastructure

Position: Postdoctoral Researcher <br>
Project: Groundwater modeling, climate change, and nature-based solutions <br>
Location: Gulf of Mexico, West Florida Shelf <br>

Join this multidisciplinary project and collaborate with a dynamic team of researchers to advance the science and practice of groundwater sustainability, and the role of nature-based infrastructure in reducing the impacts of climate change.   

##### Project Overview:
This is an EPA-funded and collaborative project between the Department of Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, and Environmental Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University, and the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University. The project focuses on addressing the challenges of sea-level rise, changing precipitation patterns, and rapid socioeconomic development, which pose threats to groundwater and community resilience in South Florida. The project will assess the effectiveness of nature-based solutions in enhancing groundwater recharge and maintaining ecosystem functions through an
integrated modeling approach.

#### Responsibilities:
As a postdoctoral researche your main responsibilities include:
- Use regional density-dependent groundwater flow models to assess the impact of climate change including precipitation and sea-level rise on groundwater resources
- Evaluate the potential of nature-based infrastructure on reducing the impacts of climate change at different scales
- Conduct sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to enhance prediction accuracy
- Disseminate the research findings by publishing them in peer-reviewed journals, by delivering presentations at scientific meetings, and through other outlets 

#### Qualifications:
- PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hydrogeology, Hydrology, or a related field
- Strong background in numerical groundwater modeling including MODFLOW family 
- Programming skilles such as Python, R, or MATLAB
- GIS skills such as ArcGIS or QGIS
- Experience with handling large and diverse datasets
- Track record of publication and research presentations

##### Benefits:
- Competitive postdoctoral salary with benefits
- Access to state-of-the-art computational resources 
- Contribute to impactful applied research that directly benefits the community 

The position will be officially posted soon and open for applications.For information, please contact [Ahmed S. Elshall](mailto:aelshall@fgcu.edu)

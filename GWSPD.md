### Postdoc Position: Groundwater modeling, nature-based infrastructure, climate change, and machine learning

Position: Postdoctoral Researcher (3 years)<br>
Project: Nature-based infrastructure for enhancing climate resiliency of groundwater resources in South Florida: An integrated modeling approach<br>
Location: South Florida <br>

Join this multidisciplinary project and collaborate with a dynamic team of researchers to advance the science and practice of groundwater sustainability, and the role of nature-based infrastructure in reducing the impacts of climate change.   

##### Project Overview:
This is an EPA-funded and collaborative project between the Department of Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, and Environmental Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University, and the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University. The project focuses on addressing the challenges of sea-level rise, changing precipitation patterns, and rapid socioeconomic development, which pose threats to groundwater and community resilience in South Florida. The project will assess the efficacy of nature-based solutions in enhancing groundwater recharge and maintaining ecosystem functions through an integrated modeling approach combining surface-water groundwater (SW-GW) models and human activities.

#### Responsibilities:
As a postdoctoral researche your main responsibilities include:
- Use an existing regional density-dependent SW-GW model to assess the impact of climate change (e.g., precipitation and sea-level rise) on groundwater resources 
- Evaluate the potential of nature-based infrastructure in reducing the impacts of climate change at different scales
- Develop machine learning-based surrogate models across scales for different purposes 
- Disseminate research findings using interactive notebooks
- Publish research findings in peer-reviewed journals, and presentat at scientific meetings
  
#### Qualifications:
- PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering, hydrogeology, hydrology, or a related field
- Strong background in numerical groundwater modeling particularly MODFLOW family
- Expereince in land-use and land-cover change with tools such as ArcGIS or QGIS
- Programming skilles such as Python, R, or MATLAB

#### Prefered Qualifications:<br> 
Experience in or interest to learn:<br>
- Google Earth engine and GeeMap
- Machine learning models and surrogate modeling
- Nature-based infrastructure

#### Benefits:
- Competitive postdoctoral salary with benefits
- Access to state-of-the-art computational resources 
- Contribute to impactful research that directly informs policy and benefits the community

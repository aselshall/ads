### EGN 4930/ EGN 5932C / OCB/EVR 4930/ OCB/EVR 6936: ST Environmental Data Science (3 credits) 

#### Course Description: 
Environmental data science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that applies computational and statistical methods to analyze environmental data. This course is an introduction to programming and scientific data analysis for water and environmental scientists and engineers. This course is project-based and research oriented.  We will explore the principles of environmental data science and its applications to environmental research using Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language for data science. You will learn how to use Python to manage, analyze, and visualize water resources and environmental data. The course will also briefly introduce machine learning and data mining techniques for analyzing complex environmental datasets. All of which can be efficiently implemented using Python's robust libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Tensorflow, and matplotlib.<br> 
<br>
In addition, you will explore packages that are specifically targeted to water resources and environmental data analysis through a self-directed learning component. First, you will be provided with a list of recommended Python packages that are relevant to water resources and environmental data analysis. Examples of this packages include 
- PyHSPF for analyzing watershed hydrology, water quality, and sediment transport,
- FloPy for creating, running, and post-processing MODFLOW groundwater models,
- OWSLib for accessing and manipulating web services for environmental data,
- GeoPandas for working with geospatial data, PyNIO for reading and writing various environmental data formats,
- PyAOS for working with atmospheric and oceanographic data,
- and PyNGL for creating high-quality visualizations of environmental data.<br>
These are just a few examples of the many Python packages that are available for working with water resources and environmental data. In addition, you will be encouraged to share your discoveries with the class, either through presentations or brief summaries. You will work individually or in small groups and the instructor will be available to provide guidance and support. By including self-directed learning opportunities in the course schedule, you will explore and experiment with a variety of Python packages that are of interest to you. This is to help you to build a deeper understanding of the packages and their applications in water resources and environmental data analysis, while also promoting independent learning and critical thinking skills.

#### Learning Outcomes: 
In this course you will learn the basic programming skills and the Python tools for data acquisition, analysis, visualization, and sharing real-world datasets that are commonly used at the interface of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. You will be expected to work individually or in a group to develop a research question or a practical problem, and use python tools to process the raw data to provide useful information and solutions. No prior python programming experience is required. This course introduces you to the Python programming language and packages that are specifically targeted to environmental data analysis. The specific learning outcomes are as follows. 
- Understand basic programming concepts
- Write python codes to manage, analyze, visualize, and share scientific data 
- Use Python to analyze datasets that are related atmospheric, ocean, and terrestrial systems to extract useful information and knowledge

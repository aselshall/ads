### Apply Your Python and Machine Learning Skills to Develop a Predictive Tool for Harmful Algal Blooms: Research Assistant Opportunity Available

[Dr. Ahmed S. Elshall](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8200-5064) is seeking an RA to work on harmful algal bloom project. 

Harmful algal blooms have become an increasingly prevalent issue in marine and freshwaters around the world, causing damage to both marine life and human health. The toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis has caused significant economic damage along the West Florida coast in recent years. As a research assistant, you will be working to develop a REd tide water quality Management Application (REMApp). The overarching objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based tool for predicting red tide in the Gulf of Mexico along the West Florida Shelf. You will  have the opportunity to explore the impact of various factors on these blooms, including upwelling, and wind speed and direction. Additionally, you will investigate the role of river flows and the nutrients they supply in regulating these algal blooms. 

#### Your Profile 
- To be considered for this position, you must have experience in Python and machine learning.
-	You should be able to start by no later than June 1, 2023.

#### We Offer
- A modest stipend of $5,000 will be provided, at a rate of $13/hour for an undergraduate student or $15/hour for a graduate student. 

#### Application
This is a great opportunity to gain hands-on research experience and contribute to the development of new tools for managing harmful algal blooms. If you are passionate about environmental data science, please send your resume and cover letter to [Dr. Ahmed S. Elshall](mailto:aelshall@fgcu.edu). I look forward to hearing from you!

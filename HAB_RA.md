For Python and machine learning students: I am seeking an RA to work on a project involving harmful algal blooms

Harmful algal blooms have become an increasingly prevalent issue in marine and freshwaters around the world, causing damage to both marine life and human health. The toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis has caused significant economic damage along the West Florida coast in recent years. As a research assistant, you will be working to develop a REd tide water quality Management Application (REMApp).  The overarching objective of this task is to develop a machine learning-based tool for predicting red tide in the Gulf of Mexico along the West Florida Shelf. The tool can be used to assess the role of river discharge and nitrogen and phosphorus loading on the probabilities of the maintenance and termination stages of red tides in the upper estuary and area of estuarine flux.  You will  have the opportunity to explore the impact of various factors on these blooms, including upwelling, and wind speed and direction. Additionally, you will investigate the role of river flows and the nutrients they supply in regulating these algal blooms. 

To be considered for this position, you must have experience in Python and machine learning. This is a great opportunity to gain hands-on research experience and contribute to the development of new tools for managing harmful algal blooms.

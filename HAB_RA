Attention all Python and machine learning students! We are currently seeking a research assistant to work on an exciting project involving harmful algal blooms.

Harmful algal blooms have become an increasingly prevalent issue in marine and freshwaters around the world, causing damage to both marine life and human health. The toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis has caused significant economic damage along the West Florida coast in recent years.

As a research assistant, you will be working with a team of experts to develop and compare four different types of machine learning algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Na√Øve Bayes classifier (NB), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - to predict these blooms. Based on a 21-year monitoring dataset, RVM and NB were found to be the most effective approaches.

You will also have the opportunity to explore the impact of various factors on these blooms, including upwelling favorable northerly winds and onshore westerly winds. Additionally, you will investigate the role of large river flows and the nutrients they supply in regulating these devastating algal blooms.

To be considered for this position, you must have experience in Python and machine learning. This is a great opportunity to gain hands-on research experience and contribute to the development of new tools for managing harmful algal blooms.

If you are passionate about environmental research and want to make a difference, please send your resume and cover letter to [insert contact information here]. We look forward to hearing from you!

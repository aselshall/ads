### Postdoc Position: Pioneering Estuary Health Prediction Using Machine Learning

Position: Postdoctoral Researcher <br>
Project: Machine Learning for Red Tide Water Quality Management Application (REMApp) <br>
Location: Gulf of Mexico, West Florida Shelf <br>

Are you passionate about applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address critical environmental challenges? We invite you to be part of an exciting opportunity to contribute to the development of the Red Tide Water Quality Management Application (REMApp) as a Postdoctoral Researcher. Red tide is a harmful algal bloom causing water discoloration and toxin release. Join this multidisciplinary project and collaborate with a dynamic team of researchers to advance our understanding of red tide dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico and make a real impact on ocean health.

##### Project Overview:
As a Postdoc on this project, you will work with a team of researchers to develop a machine learning-based tool, REMApp, that predicts red tide occurrences in the upper estuary in the Gulf of Mexico along the West Florida Shelf. Your contributions will play a pivotal role in assessing the influence of various factors, such as river discharge, nutrient loading, and environmental conditions, on red tide probabilities. 

#### Responsibilities:
- Collaborate with the project team to guide the technical development of REMApp.
- Use Python and other computational tools to analyze diverse datasets including Karenia brevis cell count, sea-surface height, river discharge, nutrient loading, meteorological variables, and more.
- Apply standard machine learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, Long Short-Term Memory network) to develop predictive models for red tide occurrences
- Lead data processing, ensuring data quality and consistency
- Evaluate model performance and refine metrics for accurate predictions
- Explain the output of Machine Learning models using various methods such as Feature Importance (Global), Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). 
- Conduct sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to enhance prediction accuracy
- Develop in-silico experiments to explore the impact of nutrient loading on red tide probabilities
- Disseminate the research findings by publishing them in peer-reviewed journals and by delivering presentations at scientific meetings.

#### Qualifications:
- PhD in Computer Science, Scientific Computing, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hydrology, Environmental Science, Oceanography, or a related field
- Strong background in machine learning, data analysis, and environmental modeling
- Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R
- Experience with handling large and diverse datasets
- Excellent communication skills for collaboration within an interdisciplinary team
- Track record of publication and research presentations

Benefits:
- Competitive postdoctoral salary with benefits
- Flexibility to work remotely, even from outside the state of Florida
- Access to state-of-the-art computational resources 
- Opportunity to collaborate with leading experts in oceanography and environmental science
- Contribute to impactful applied research that directly benefits the community
